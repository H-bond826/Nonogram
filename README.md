# The Rules

The objective of this game is to uncover a board of blue cells and free cells. You can achieve this by following the definitions for the rows and columns â€“ sequences of numbers that describe the groups of blue cells appearing on these rows and columns. For example, 1 5 2 represents: 1 cell, 5 cells, and 2 blue cells, each separated by one or more empty cells.

Click on the cells once to mark them as occupied. Click again to mark them with an X. This allows you to indicate cells you consider to be empty. Click on the cells once more to return them to their initial state.
